# Vacation Days

See when you’re free.

<b>It only takes a glance.</b> View your vacation days in one of two layouts: a timeline or a calendar. And with counters in the top bar, see how many vacation days you have this year — and how many are left.

<b>Sorted in seconds.</b> Tap the floating button to add new vacation days. Enter a name, swipe to select a date range, and you’re done.

<b>Switching phones?</b> With Vacation Days, back up all your data in an instant and restore it on your next device. You can also make periodic backups to keep your data safe.

<b>Night owls, rejoice.</b> Because Vacation Days has a beautiful Dark Mode for late-night viewing. Toggle it automatically or have it follow the system appearance.
